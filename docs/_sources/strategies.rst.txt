Comparison of strategies
========================

Different strategies
--------------------

Different coloring strategies lead to different results, but also have
different performance. It all depends on preferences, what is the goal.

If one want visually balanced result, ``'balanced'`` strategy could be
the right choice. It comes with four different modes of balancing -
``'count'``, ``'area'``, ``'distance'``, and ``'centroid'``. The first
one attempts to balance the number of features per each color, second
the area covered by each color, and two last based on the distance
between features. Either represented by the geometry itself or its
centroid (a bit faster).

Other strategies might be helpful if one wants to minimize number of
colors as not all strategies use the same amount in the end. Or they
just might look better on your map. Strategies used in ``greedy`` have two origins - ``'balanced'`` is
ported from QGIS while the rest comes from ``networkX``.

Below is a comparison of performance and the result of each of the
strategies supported by ``greedy``.

.. code:: python

    import geopandas as gpd
    import pandas as pd
    from time import time
    import numpy as np
    import libpysal
    import seaborn as sns
    sns.set()

    from greedy import greedy

When using ``'balanced'`` strategy with ``'area'``, ``'distance'``, or
``'centroid'`` modes, keep in mind that your data needs to be in
projected CRS to obtain correct results. For the simplicity of this
comparison, letâ€™s pretend that dataset below is (even though it is not).

.. code:: python

    world = gpd.read_file(gpd.datasets.get_path('naturalearth_lowres'))


Performance
-----------

Code below generates each option 20 times and returns the mean time elapsed together
with the number of colors used.

.. code:: python

    strategies = ['balanced', 'largest_first', 'random_sequential',
                  'smallest_last', 'independent_set',
                  'connected_sequential_bfs', 'connected_sequential_dfs',
                  'saturation_largest_first']
    balanced_modes = ['count', 'area', 'centroid', 'distance']

    times = {}
    sw = libpysal.weights.Queen.from_dataframe(
        world, ids=world.index.to_list(), silence_warnings=True
    )
    for strategy in strategies:
        if strategy == 'balanced':
            for mode in balanced_modes:
                print(strategy, mode)
                timer = []
                for run in range(20):
                    s = time()
                    colors = greedy(world, strategy=strategy,
                                    balance=mode, sw=sw)
                    e = time() - s
                    timer.append(e)
                world[strategy + '_' + mode] = colors
                times[strategy + '_' + mode] = np.mean(timer)
                print('time: ', np.mean(timer), 's; ',
                      np.max(colors) + 1, 'colors')
        else:
            print(strategy)
            timer = []
            for run in range(20):
                s = time()
                colors = greedy(world, strategy=strategy, sw=sw)
                e = time() - s
                timer.append(e)
            world[strategy] = colors
            times[strategy] = np.mean(timer)
            print('time: ', np.mean(timer), 's; ',
                  np.max(colors) + 1, 'colors')


As you can see below, ``smallest_last`` and ``saturation_largest_first`` were
able, for this particular dataset, to generate greedy coloring using
only 4 colors. If one wants to use higher number than the minimal,
``'balanced'`` strategy allows setting of ``min_colors`` to be used.

vertical axis is in seconds using log scale.

Resulting maps
--------------

Below are all results plotted on the map.

.. code:: python

    for strategy in times.index:
        ax = world.plot(strategy, categorical=True, figsize=(16, 12),
                        cmap='Set3', legend=True)
        ax.set_axis_off()
        ax.set_title(strategy)


Balance by ``'count'`` is the fastest of all algorithms, but not always
leads to the optimal results. Colors can be close to each other and
if the sizes of polygons are disproportionally distributed, it might
not look nice:

.. image:: images/strategies/output_9_0.png


Balance by ``'area'`` tries to cover the same areas with each color. Consider the largest country
- Russia uses color which is not used by many other:


.. image:: images/strategies/output_9_1.png

Balance by distance between ``'centroids'`` generate colors to be equally distributed across the map.
However, using centroids might cause some inaccuracy (consider USA with Alaska and Hawaii):

.. image:: images/strategies/output_9_2.png

Balance by ``'distance'`` between polygons attempts to do the same as ``'centroids'``, but using
the whole geometries. For that reason, it can be really slow:

.. image:: images/strategies/output_9_3.png

Strategies ``'smallest_last'`` and ``'saturation_largest_first'`` are the most effective for this particular dataset
as they result in 4 colors only:
